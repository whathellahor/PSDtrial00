
# In Week 10 labs, we will practice the version control and branching. 

Please use **git clone** command to duplicate this repository into your local PC first. 


## 1. Revise the file2.txt file before creating a git branch.Then add some messages in the file2.txt file as follows. Then use git commit to update the changes in your local repository.

>
> This is the master branch
>
> This is the message before branching.
>
> There is no other branch. 
>


## 2. Next, create a branch named "branch01", and switch the HEAD to the branch01. 

>
> Use: **git checkout** command. 
>

## 3. Under "branch01", revise the file2.txt file as follows. Then use git commit to update the changes in your local repository.

>
> This is the branch01 branch. 
>
> Hello branch01, once.
>

## 4. Next, switch to the master branch. Under "branch01", revise the file2.txt file as follows. Then use git commit to update the changes in your local repository.

>
> This is the master branch. 
>
> Hello master, once.
>

## 5. Now there are two parallel branches with different contents in file2.txt. 


## 6. Next, create a branch named "branch02", and switch the HEAD to the branch02. 


## 7. Under the branch02, add the contents into file2.txt. Then use git commit to update the changes in your local repository.

>
> This is the branch02 branch. 
>
> Hello branch02, once.
>

## 8. Switch to the master branch, add the contents into file2.txt. 

>
> This is the master branch. 
>
> Hello master, twice.
>

Then delete the message **There is no other branch.** from the file2.txt. Use git commit to update the changes in your local repository.


# The final tasks are: please merge the branch02 and branch 01 into the master branch.
